## Reveal.js

`reveal.js` is a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using
HTML. You'll need a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms to see it in
its full glory. 

And any Madoko features just work. Here is some math:

~ Begin Framed { padding:1ex; margin-top:1ex }
A famous equation is $e = mc^2$, but this one is 
famous too:

~ Equation  {#eq-gaussian}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-a x^2} d x = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}} 
~
~ End Framed

~~ Notes
Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you
can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
~~



## Themes {#themes}

Reveal.js comes with a few themes built in:

* [Default](?#/themes)
* [Sky](?theme=sky#/themes)
* [Beige](?theme=beige#/themes)
* [Serif](?theme=serif#/themes)
* [Simple](?theme=simple#/themes)
* [Night](?theme=night#/themes)
* [Moon](?theme=moon#/themes)
* [Solarized](?theme=solarized#/themes)

Theme demos are loaded after the presentation which leads to flicker. In
production you should load your theme in the `<head>` using a
`<link>`.

## Transitions { #transitions }

You can select from different transitions, like:\
[Cube](?transition=cube#/transitions) -
[Page](?transition=page#/transitions) -
[Concave](?transition=concave#/transitions) -
[Zoom](?transition=zoom#/transitions) -
[Linear](?transition=linear#/transitions) -
[Fade](?transition=fade#/transitions) -
[None](?transition=none#/transitions) -
[Default](?#/transitions)

## Point of View

In Reveal.js Press **ESC** to enter the slide overview.

Hold down alt and click on any element to zoom in on it using 
 [zoom.js]. Alt + click anywhere to zoom back out.

## Works in Mobile Safari

Try it out! You can swipe through the slides and pinch your way to the
overview.


## Printing

You can print a `revealjs` presentation nicely from the browser.

First give the `?print-pdf` or `?print-paper` query on your final
presentation (in the browser address bar) and then print from the Chrome
browser selecting `Save to PDF`.

Read more about it at the [revealjs documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export)
