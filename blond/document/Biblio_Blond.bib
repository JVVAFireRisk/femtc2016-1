abstract = {"Drysdale's book is by far the most comprehensive - everyone in the office has a copy...now including me. It holds just about everything you need to know about fire science."(Review of An Introduction to Fire Dynamics, 2nd Edition)After 25 years as a bestseller, Dougal Drysdale's classic introduction has been brought up-to-date and expanded to incorporate the latest research and experimental data. Homework problems are included, with solutions, and others are available on the accompanying website at www.wiley.com/go/drysdale. Essential reading for all involved in the field from undergraduate and postgraduate students to practising fire safety engineers and fire prevention officers, An Introduction to Fire Dynamics is unique in that it addresses the fundamentals of fire science and fire dynamics, thus providing the scientific background necessary for the development of fire safety engineering as a professional discipline.An Introduction to Fire DynamicsIncludes experimental data relevant to the understanding of fire behaviour of materials;Features numerical problems with answers illustrating the quantitative applications of the concepts presented;Extensively course-tested at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of Edinburgh, and widely adopted throughout the world;Will appeal to all those working in fire safety engineering and related disciplines.},
