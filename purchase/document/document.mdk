~ Abstract
This paper utilizes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and evacuation
modeling to compare different evacuation configurations in a metro rail
tunnel. Different configurations are based on variations in the exit
spacing, walkway width and elevation, and the use of longitudinal ventilation for smoke
control. The interaction of these evacuation configurations with the
tunnel grade and tunnel area are also considered. The different
configurations are quantitatively compared on the basis of standard
tenability criteria such as visibility, but also using a Fractional
Effective Dosage concept regarding asphyxiates.

# INTRODUCTION { #sec-intro }
## Background 
A rail tunnel is a relatively simple geometric structure. However,
complexities and uncertainties associated with a fire event mean that
designing for evacuation of a train in a tunnel is not a simple process [@Purchase2013]. If a
fire is detected on a train, the typical strategy is to continue to the
next station. This allows detrainment to be better managed with egress
routes that are more familiar to people [@Purchase2013].

There is still a residual risk that a fire occurs on the train
while in the tunnel and the train is unable to reach the station. This
could be the result of mechanical failure or congested network
conditions. While this scenario might be unlikely, it is usually deemed
credible enough to require tunnel evacuation provisions. However,
the evacuation provisions can impact the overall structural design and
project cost. A balance is therefore required between cost and safety.

Typical evacuation provisions for rail tunnels vary between countries. In
general terms, walkway widths tend to be between approximately 0.7m to
1.5m, exit spacings between approximately 240m to 500m and there is
differing guidance on the walkway location and elevation [@FIT2Rail;
@FIT2Metro; @NFPA130-2014; @TSI]. The use of longitudinal ventilation for
smoke control also varies. In countries such as the United States, United
Kingdom and Australia, it is the authors' experiences that longitudinal
smoke control is typically provided. In other countries, such as Sweden,
this is not as common. Longitudinal smoke control in rail tunnels may also be perceived
to increase the risk to life safety [@FIT2Rail].

Given the number of rail tunnels worldwide it is interesting, but not
surprising, that there is so much variation in requirements and standard
practice. Performance-based fire engineering is usually employed when it
comes to rail tunnel design and this is necessitated by the nuances with
each system. However, when a provision is viewed in isolation this can
be misleading when benchmarking a design, or be confusing for 
stakeholders or other design disciplines.

This paper aims to investigate a range of tunnel evacuation design
configurations and the impact that these have on evacuation safety. The inputs
and scenarios are focused on a metro tunnel, but the concepts are likely
applicable to other rail tunnel systems. This paper is not intended to
provide a 'solution' to rail tunnel evacuation, and this
approach is in no-way advocated. Instead, this paper provides a
comparative set of results that can be used by fire safety designers when
developing their own options for further assessment.

## Previous Research 
A detailed review of previous research into rail tunnel evacuation, smoke
control strategies and operational strategies is beyond the scope of a
paper. The focus of this short literature review is relevant studies that
provide similar insight and approaches, and for context for later discussions. 

The concept of longitudinal smoke control is well developed in the
literature [@Wu2000; @Kennedy1996; @NFPA130-2014; @NFPA502-2014; @SVS6].
Achieving critical velocity provides a clear path for evacuation on one
side of the fire, and is also beneficial for fire service intervention.
This is often a key criteria to demonstrate fire safety in rail tunnels
in countries where longitudinal smoke control is typically
provided  [@NFPA130-2014; @TfNSW]. The alternative point of view is that
knowing which way to direct the smoke may depend on the fire location and
require a level of judgment that could result in smoke being directed
over evacuating people [@Carvel2016].

Guidelines and standards typically provide maximum recommended or
allowable tunnel exit spacings [@FIT2Rail]. The final spacing might be a
function of other considerations such as geology or stakeholder
requirements. Edenbaum et al. [@Edenbaum2006] used SIMULEX [@SIMULEX] to
investigate the spacing of rail cross-passages accounting for different
walkway widths in view of the requirements of NFPA 130 [@NFPA130-2014, 2003 Ed.].
This work concluded that a performance based approach allows for
trade-offs between cross-passage spacing, walkway width and
fire-hardening of the rail vehicle.

The elevation of a tunnel walkway can determine the ease of
detrainment. In some instances detrainment could also be via the ends of
the train to a central track-level walkway [@Purchase2013]. A wider walkway should
increase people flows, reducing the evacuation time. Lundström et
al. [@LUNDSTROM2014] studied walkway design and the effect this has on
evacuation behavior in rail tunnels. This work outlined that an elevated
walkway may be beneficial for mobility impaired, but might also result in
a fear of falling and reduced movement speeds. This work considered
different walkway widths and an empirical relationship was developed for
the flow of people with differing widths.

Fridolf [@FridolfPHD] provides a detailed review of human behavior in
rail tunnels, including a significant database of empirical and field
observations of rail tunnel evacuation. The database is a compilation,
which consist of data and information related to train evacuation in rail
tunnels as well as the succeeding tunnel evacuation and exit choice. It
includes the work of empirical studies conducted by others, and is
complemented with Fridolf's own work in both the laboratory and field
(among other things, a full-scale evacuation experiment in the Stockholm
Metro, including 135 participants). In addition, suggestions and
recommendations on how that data be used in the application and for
design is given.

Kučera and Bradáčová [@Kucer2014] undertook FDS modeling of a
bi-directional, 700m long rail tunnel fire. Fires were modelled on
5% grade and with an applied velocity of 1m/s with a maximum fire size of
12MW. Evacuation simulations were undertaken with FDS+Evac [@FDS-EVAC],
with 640 people, a maximum exit distance of approximately 660m and 1.5m
wide walkway on both sides of the tunnel. For the scenarios considered
they concluded that no people would be exposed to untenable conditions.

Winkler and Carvel [@Carvel2016] investigated ventilation and egress
strategies for passenger train fires in tunnels. This work concluded that
if passengers are on both sides of the fire that longitudinal ventilation
should not be used as people could be exposed to untenable conditions
within a few minutes. The authors put particular emphasis that the
conclusions are only applicable to the scenarios modelled. The fire
curves used were intended to represent high-speed rail, and included a
linear growth from 0 to 45MW in 4 minutes and a linear growth from 0 to
10MW in 20 minutes. The larger fire was intended to account for the
impact that applied ventilation could have on the fire size.

# INPUTS AND MODELING METHODOLOGY

## Limitations
The intent of this paper is to develop a comparative set of results for
different evacuation configurations in a metro rail tunnel. However, the
work in this paper is no substitute for a project specific fire safety
analysis. It should be understood that to simplify the number of
simulations and to provide direct comparison of key parameters, some
inputs have been kept constant that might vary in reality. This is
discussed in the following sections.

The inputs and assumptions in this paper are nominal, and while informed
by project experience, they do not represent any particular project.
Furthermore, the presentation of results is nominal and comparative, and
no result should be interpreted as being acceptable to the authors or any
particular jurisdiction. Considerations such as stakeholder requirements
and other practical constraints might govern the fire safety provision
for a particular project and what is deemed acceptable. A risk analysis
might also be used to justify the credible design fire scenarios. No
consideration of likelihood has been considered in this paper.

Tunnel aerodynamics at the time of a fire event, particularly in metro
systems, can be complex and vary with many factors including non-incident
train movements, atmospheric conditions, normal operations ventilation
and incident train piston flows. To properly implement boundary
conditions for a project specific CFD analysis a 1-D aerodynamic model
such as SES [@SVS6] could be used. For this comparative study the
boundary conditions used are intended to represent possible flow
conditions during a fire with limited consideration of airflow transients.    


## Scenario Selection
Table [#ScenarioTable] shows a simplified set of parameters that were
considered for the CFD and evacuation modeling. If each parameters is
considered independent, then combining these in a parametric evacuation
study would require over 100,000 separate evacuation simulations. To limit the number
of scenarios the values in _italics_ were selected. This resulted in 12
separate CFD models and 144 evacuation scenarios. The parameters selected
are intended to focus on the interaction of the walkway width and elevation,
exit spacing, tunnel area and grade, and in-tunnel velocity conditions on
evacuation outcomes. Figure [#fig-Scenario] shows a schematic of the
scenarios modelled.

The front of the train is assumed to come to a stop at a tunnel exit. For
a tunnel without ventilation the worst case could be a fire at the front
of the train that blocks an exit and results in the greatest distance to
an alternative exit. For a tunnel with ventilation the smoke control
strategy is likely to be dependent on the location of the fire on the
train. This requires an operator decision or control loop that is simple
if the fire is at one end of the train, but may require judgment if the
fire is located towards the center of the train. For this reason the fire
was located in the middle car, but biased towards the closest exit. This
is considered a reasonable scenario to compare a ventilated and
non-ventilated solution.

The walkway and exit spacing were guided based on a possible design in a particular
jurisdiction. For instance, a tunnel with an 800mm elevated walkway, 240m
exit spacing and longitudinal ventilation to achieve critical velocity
might be representative of (or exceed) a NFPA 130 compliant
design [@NFPA130-2014], that might also be applicable in other countries
such as Australia [@TfNSW]. On the other hand, a 1200mm track level
walkway, 300m or 500m exit spacing and no tunnel ventilation might be
representative of a European design [@FIT2Rail]. The
walkway width could also govern the structural design and resulting
tunnel cross-section. This is discussed as part of the CFD geometry.

A single fire curve (5MW, medium t-squared, $\alpha = 0.012kW/s^2$) was
used for all evacuation scenarios. In reality, this may not necessarily
be the case with varying ventilation [@Carvel2016] and tunnel
geometries [@Wu2014] impacting the fire curve. However, a constant fire
curve allowed the impact of the evacuation configurations to be compared.
A value of 5MW may not represent a worst-case for metro rollingstock.
Based on project experience this value is considered reasonable in view
of a possible project design requirement or a 'credible' tunnel
evacuation design case.

Other parameters such as the fire size, fire growth rate, pre-movement
time and occupant load were nominally selected. These parameters could
vary significantly between projects, but the values selected were
considered somewhat typical based on project experience. The grade
could also vary significantly. Tunnel grades of 0% and 4% were
nominally selected, albeit a 4% grade could be towards the higher end for
a metro system. The grades are relative to the people movement with a
positive grade having more potential for buoyant smoke to move in the
direction of evacuation.

## CFD Modeling
The CFD modeling was undertaken with FDS version 6.1.2 [@FDSUserGuide].
The fire was modelled with the spread-rate function used to approximate
the medium t-squared growth rate. Once the fire reaches peak heat release
rate it is kept at this value with no decay modelled. A soot yield of
0.1kg/kg and a CO yield of 0.1kg/kg were used, along with a heat of
combustion of 20MJ/kg.

Grid sizes of 0.2m were used across the train length and approximately
10m beyond the train ends. In the open sections grid sizes of 0.4m were
used. This resulted in characteristic fire parameters [@FDSUserGuide] of
$D^*/dx = 9.1$ and $Q^*=2.2$ in the vicinity of the fire. A grid
convergence study was not undertaken, however, grid sizes are considered adequate
based on previous experience.

The tunnel was modelled as being 900m in length. This allows for the
maximum exit spacing of 500m. At least 100m of tunnel was allowed beyond
each exit to keep the areas of interest away from the boundary
conditions. The two tunnel cross-sections were modelled as per
Figure [#fig-geometry]. The width varies to allow for different
cross-sectional areas. The tunnel height was kept constant to eliminate
another variable for consideration.

A walkway of 1200mm can be accommodated in both tunnel cross-sections
and is included in the evacuation scenarios. For the 23m^2^ tunnel this
might be impractical due to tunnel services or curvature reducing the
effective walkway width, but is still considered to compare the impact of
the reduced tunnel area. For the 29m^2^ tunnel a 800mm walkway on
the opposite side to the evacuation walkway could be accommodated, but
this was not used in the evacuation analysis. 

The train was modelled with a cross-sectional area of approximately
11m^2^ with a length of approximately 140m. The train is a three car
consist, although each car is modelled as being a separate unit without
inter-car doors (i.e. smoke cannot spread inside the train between cars).
The train doors were modelled to be closed until the start of evacuation.
Windows stayed in-tact for the duration of the simulation. The fire was
not oxygen limited.

## Evacuation Modeling
A simple 1-dimensional model was developed to undertake the evacuation
assessment. The model was programmed in Perl [@PERL], with inputs defined
in text files and batch scripts used as drivers to the main program.
This enabled the 144 evacuation simulations presented in this paper to be
undertaken with minimal human input once the base files were setup. This
approach was considered suitable for the current investigation due to the
relatively simple evacuation routes. This approach also provides complete
control of the evacuation correlations and flow rates. It is acknowledged
that the model does not include the more complex interactions in software
such as Pathfinder [@PATHFINDER] and STEPs [@STEPS]. However, the 1-D
model has been used to produce results that are comparable to these more
advanced methods for similar tunnel situations.

Agents are tracked in the evacuation model along a walkway path defined
in the FDS model. Along the path FDS devices are used to record
visibility, temperature, CO, CO~2~ and O~2~ at the track level (2m) and
elevated (3.2m) walkway tenability heights. A temporal resolution of 1
second and an averaged spatial resolution of 5m are used to record these
values. A quasi-Lagrangian method is used to track agent locations which
enables their exposure to reduced visibility and their accumulated Fractional
Incapacitating  Dose (FID) to be calculated.

The agent FID at each time-step is calculated using the same equations
implemented in Pathfinder [@PATHFINDER] and FDS+EVAC [@FDS-EVAC], which
are based on the work of Purser [@Purser2009;@PurserSFPE]. The
contribution from HCN and other irritants are not included in the
calculation of FID. The FID is only accumulated once the occupants are
leaving the train and while in the tunnel. Therefore, results may not be
conservative for agents in the fire car, but the same simplification is
used across all scenarios.

A hydraulic model is used to regulate the movement of agents along the
walkway accounting for crowding and the walkway width. For the flow rate
of agents along the walkway, the same correlation was used independent of
the walkway elevation. A fixed correlation enables a direct comparison of
the impact of the agents being closer to the smoke layer for the elevated
walkway. Equation [#flowratewalkway] shows the correlation
used [@AhlfontMSC;@LUNDSTROM2014]:

~ Equation { #FlowRateWalkway }
Flow\ rate\ of\ people\ [p/s]=1.27 \cdot walkway\ width[m]+0.07
~

When agents are walking adjacent to the train this situation is
considered similar to a corridor. The correlation given in the Swedish
building guidelines for analytical fire safety design [@BBRAD] was
adopted and shown as equation [#flowratenexttotrain].

~ Equation { #FlowRateNextToTrain }
Flow\ rate\ of\ people\ [p/s]=1.2 \cdot walkway\ width[m]
~

In reduced visibility conditions the walking speed is based on the
relation by Fridolf et al. [@Fridolf2013]. This is shown as
Equation [#walkingspeed], where $x$ is the extinction coefficient. A
maximum speed of 1.2m/s is allowed, with a minimum speed of 0.3m/s. There
is no reduction in walking speed with grade which is consistent with
field measurement with grades of 4.5% [@NorenWiner2003].

~ Equation { #WalkingSpeed }
Walking\ speed\ [m/s]=-1.1423 \cdot x + 1.177
~

There are seven doors per car that enable agents to evacuate onto the
walkway. Detrainment is based on a door flow of 0.2p/s regardless of the
walkway height. There is considerable variation in field measurements for
detrainment to an elevated or track-level walkway [@FridolfPHD, Table 6],
however a value of 0.2p/s appears to be plausible, albeit conservative, for both
configurations. Agents can only leave the train if the walkway density is
less than 4p/m^2^ which ultimately determines the detrainment rate. The
tunnel exits are assumed to be 2m wide with a door flow of 2p/s.

Agents are evenly distributed along the train (i.e. 3 cars x 300 agents
per car). Each agent is randomly assigned a group which defines their
maximum walking speed. The varying agent groups are intended to provide a
spread of capabilities which could represent that of the general
population. To do this 10% of agents were assigned a maximum walking
speed of 0.8m/s which could be indicative of mobility impaired or
children. A further 70% were assigned a maximum walking speed of 1.0m/s
to represent the majority of the population. The remainder were assigned
a maximum walking speed of 1.2m/s. It should be noted that the walking
speed achieved by each agent is ultimately a function of crowding,
visibility conditions and walkway flow rates.

To estimate occupant tenability accumulated FIDs were calculated for each
agent. As defined by ISO 13571 [@ISO-13571-2012], an accumulated FID of 1.0
corresponds to a log-normal distribution of responses, with statistically
50% of the population expected to experience tenable conditions, with 50%
then expected to experience compromised tenability. The threshold
criteria of accumulated FID $\geq$ 0.3 used for this assessment translates to 11.4%
of the population being statistically susceptible to compromised
tenability [@ISO-13571-2012].

# RESULTS

## Visibility and Other Tenability
Visibility results from the CFD simulations are shown in
Figure [#fig-Vis-0-23] and Figure [#fig-Vis-4-23]. Results are only shown
for the 23m^2^ tunnel. Results for the 29m^2^ tunnel are very similar,
albeit visibility is slightly improved due to the larger cross-section.
However, the variation in visibility is better quantified with the
results presented with the evacuation assessment.

The visibility results are displayed as a function of distance from the
fire (X) and increasing time (T). XT figures provide a convenient way of
representing a large amount of transient data without having to display
numerous contours. These figures were produced with the FDS device output
for visibility and post-processed in GNU Octave [@Octave].

Exit 1 is the exit closest to the fire and the multiple exit options are
also indicated as vertical lines. The XT contours have been clipped such
that visibility greater than 10m is shown as white space. Visibility is
based on a light emitting surface (C = 8 [@FDSUserGuide]). The contours
are produced for a track-level walkway (2m above track) and elevated
walkway (3.2m above track). The figures show 30 minutes of simulation
time as outcomes are obvious after this period, although the simulations
were run for 60 minutes.

XT figures were also used to check all components of tenability (i.e.
temperature, CO, CO~2~, and O~2~). For reasons of space these are not
presented, but are part of the FID assessment. For all scenarios,
temperatures at tenability heights were less than 60 &deg;C away from the
immediate vicinity of the fire site, and less than 40 &deg;C beyond the
ends of the train.

For the still air conditions on 0% grade there is a somewhat symmetrical
spread of smoke which is biased one way due to the asymmetry in the fire
location relative to the train length. When the still air conditions are
modelled on 4% grade the smoke buoyancy induces a significant airflow in
the tunnel. For a real system the magnitude of this airflow could vary
depending on many factors, but for the scenario modelled, the high grade
results in a situation similar to a tunnel with forced ventilation.

When a pressure boundary is applied the smoke is biased towards the
direction of evacuation, but significant backlayering still occurs. While
the pressure boundary is based on a velocity of 2m/s, the velocity
achieved in the tunnel is much lower (~0.3-0.5m/s for 0% grade) due to
pressure losses associated with tunnel friction, the train blockage and
fire. The achieved velocity could vary for another model setup. A
pressure boundary was used to allow smoke to overcome the upstream
boundary and to illustrate a velocity condition less than critical
velocity. With a 4% grade, the flow is biased toward the direction of
egress for the reasons noted above.

When a critical velocity is modelled the outcome is as expected. The
tunnel ventilation is started at 300 seconds and ramps to capacity in 60
seconds. The calculated critical velocity for each area and grade varied,
but was generally estimated [@NFPA130-2014] to be 1-1.3m/s upstream of
the 5MW design fire in the clear tunnel area. Once this occurs smoke is
driven in one direction. There is a small amount of back-layering
noticeable for the 0% grade simulations suggesting the critical velocity
used was slightly under-sized, but this does not impact the evacuation
assessments. For the fire size used, this is likely corrected by the
latest critical velocity calculations from NFPA [@NFPA502-2017].

The XT figures also show the variation in walkway elevation and tunnel
cross section. In general terms, visibility conditions are more favorable
for a track-level walkway with a larger tunnel cross-section. This result
is expected as the smoke layer is higher relative to the agents on the
walkway.

For the models with a significant airflow in the tunnel, a region of
increased visibility occurs between the fire location and the end of the
train. This is due to the increased velocity associated with
the restricted (annulus) area across the train. This causes dilution of
the combustion gases relative to the full tunnel cross section. This
effect is more noticeable for the track-level walkway than for the
elevated walkway which suggests that even with tunnel ventilation applied
a degree of smoke layering is still present for the fire considered.

## Evacuation and Accumulated FID
Four sets of results are presented that compare the different parameters
selected from Table [#scenariotable]. Accumulated FID results have been truncated at
unity. Other results have been normalized to present values between zero
and unity. The normalization used for each result is provided in the
figure title and is convenient to show a fraction of the worst-case
outcome across the scenarios considered.

The results for the evacuation assessment are generally as expected. As
the exit spacing increases and the walkway width decreases, the maximum accumulated
FIDs (Figure [#fig-Max-FID]), number of agents exposed to accumulated FID $\geq$ 0.3
(Figure [#fig-No-FID]), number of visibility exposures
(Figure [#fig-No-Vis]) and total evacuation time (Figures [#fig-Max-Evac])
all increase. The walkway width and exit spacing directly affect the time
that occupants are in the tunnel and exposed to combustion gases. The
relative magnitude of these increases for different exit spacing and
walkway widths is a function of the walkway elevation, tunnel boundary
conditions and tunnel grade.

Two walkway elevations were investigated. Accumulated FID and low visibility
exposures are generally reduced with a track-level walkway compared to
the elevated walkway. This is because the walkway elevation affects the
height of agents relative to the smoke layer. It could be argued that an
elevated walkway facilitates more rapid detrainment, particularly for
mobility impaired and children. For the two walkway elevations the same
detrainment flow rate was assumed and crowding of the walkway reduced the
effective detrainment flow rates. This, however, does not consider nuances
associated with mobility impaired detrainment to a track level walkway or
onto an elevated walkway with insufficient width to enable turning of
mobility aids.

The use of longitudinal smoke control and a high grade are similar. As
discussed for the visibility results, the models with tunnel grade
resulted in an airflow that effectively provided a critical velocity
across the fire site, preventing backlayering and directing the products
of combustion towards the majority of evacuating agents. However, a
velocity due to the tunnel ventilation or grade effect caused dilution
across the train and improved tenability. This is in contrast to a flat
grade without an applied velocity where exposures are generally higher.
However, the results are not as definite with a 500m exit spacing without
an applied velocity. For some 500m exit spacing configurations agents
start to out-pace the worst of the naturally developing smoke layer.

The effect of an applied velocity is interesting and somewhat
counter-intuitive particularly when compared to the conclusions drawn by
Winkler and Carvel [@Carvel2016]. But direct comparison between the data
sets is difficult due to the different fires and intended rollingstock.
While fire size and ventilation interaction were not considered in the
current work, it does seem reasonable that as the fire size increases,
any dilution effect is diminished due to the increased formation of
combustion products. What is interesting from the current results is that
if high grades exist then a non-ventilated solution could in-fact be
similar to a ventilated tunnel, but without the control possible with
mechanical ventilation.

# CONCLUSION
This paper utilizes CFD and evacuation modeling to compare different
evacuation configurations in a metro rail tunnel. This is based on a
specific set of inputs and assumptions. While likely applicable to a
broad-range of projects, the complexity of metro systems makes it
impractical to investigate all possible configurations and inputs.
Simplifications were used to focus on particular configurations of exit
spacing, walkway width and elevation, and in-tunnel velocity conditions.
The interaction with tunnel grade and area are also considered.

The tunnel fires were modelled with FDS and the output used to visualize
visibility for different configurations. Visibility provides an insight
into the smoke movement which is a broad indication of tenability
conditions. These results showed the influence of tunnel grade on smoke
movement and the effect that an applied velocity has on conditions across
the length of the train. These results also showed the difference in
visibility between a track level and elevated walkway. 

An evacuation assessment was used to further understand the influence that
different evacuation configurations could have on tenability. The results for
the evacuation assessment are generally as expected. As the exit spacing
increases and the walkway width decreases, the maximum accumulated FIDs, number of
agents exposed to accumulated FID $\geq$ 0.3, number of visibility exposures and
total evacuation time all increase. However, the relative magnitude of
these increases is a function of the walkway elevation, tunnel boundary
conditions and tunnel grade.

From a purely fire safety perspective, a larger tunnel cross-section with
wide walkways and closely spaced exits is likely to be preferred. With
this configuration the walkway elevation, tunnel grade, atmospheric
conditions and use of longitudinal ventilation may not be as critical to
the outcome. This result is somewhat obvious, but the reality is that an
ideal configuration from a fire safety perspective is rarely practical or
cost effective. In real projects trade-offs are required to arrive at an
optimized solution that accounts for project-specific constraints and
other practicalities.
