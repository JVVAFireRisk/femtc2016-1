1. Introduction
2. Multi-scale Modelling

# Introduction - Team

* Work carried out in 2014
* Led by Edmund Ang (Imperial College London), with collaborators: 
  - Guillermo Rein (Imperial College London)
  - Joaquin Peiro (Imperial College London)
  - Roger Harrison (AECOM UK)
  - Izabella Vermesi (Imperial College London)
* Special thanks to software support from Thunderhead Engineering

# Introduction - Multi-scale Modelling

* Multi-scale modelling based on Colella _et al_ [1]
* Previous work based on commercial CFD package and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes
* Multi-scale modelling using FDS6:
  - Not attempted before
  - Enabled by the FDS HVAC feature 
  - Proof of concept by Vermesi _et al_ [2] 
  - Constant flow specified at boundary
  - No coupling of jet fans to the fire behaviour

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why 

* Increasingly denser and taller buildings
  - Scarcity of land resources 
  - High rise buildings
  - Options for above ground rail or utility network limited
* Tunnel is often the more practical solution 
* Tunnels can be used for rail, roads or utilities 

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Ventilation is needed to most tunnels
  - Life safety (fumes or CO from fire)
  - Regulating temperature (train operation)
* Three main types of ventilation system
  - Longitudinal (jet fans)
  - Transverse (ducted supply and extract)
  - Semi-transverse (hybrid of ducted and non-ducted)

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Design of tunnel ventilation system 
* 1D / Subway Environment Simulation (SES)
  - Early stages of design
  - Fast computation
  - Provides global averaged prediction
  - Limitations on gas species or high resolution calculations

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* 3D / Full CFD simulation
  - To validate the design carried out at the earlier stages
  - Time consuming
  - Provides high resolution predictions, e.g. gas species and combustion
  - Tunnel section models often shorten to reduce computational time
* Is there a best of both world? 

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Multi-scale modelling method
* Using 1D for far field tunnel sections
* Full CFD for near field, or tunnel section of interest
* Significantly reduce the computational time
* Off-set computational time for longer tunnel section
  

## Reveal.js

`reveal.js` is a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using
HTML. You'll need a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms to see it in
its full glory. 

And any Madoko features just work. Here is some math:

~ Begin Framed { padding:1ex; margin-top:1ex }
A famous equation is $e = mc^2$, but this one is 
famous too:

~ Equation  {#eq-gaussian}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-a x^2} d x = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}} 
~
~ End Framed

~~ Notes
Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you
can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
~~

## Code

Here is code, highlighted by Madoko 

``` javascript
function sqr( x ) {
  var \(&pi;\) = 3.141593;
  return x*x;  /* the square */
}
```
We used `\(` and `\)` to escape into markdown to write &pi;.

<!-- Example of nested vertical slides -->
~ Begin Vertical { data-background:Gainsboro }

## Vertical Slides {#vertical}
Slides can be nested inside of other slides,
try pressing [down].

[![arrowdown]][down]


[down]: # { .navigate-down }
[arrowdown]: images/arrow.png "Down arrow" { width:178px; height:238px }

## Basement Level 1
Press down or up to navigate.

## Basement Level 2

Use `columns` to put blocks next to each other:

~ Begin Columns
~ Column { width:50% }
A monarch butterfly (shown to the right)
spends the winter in Mexico.
~
~ Column
![butterfly]
~
~ End Columns

[butterfly]: images/butterfly.png "A Monarch butterfly" { width:280px; vertical-align:middle }


<!-- 
For local background images, we need to have a reference to the image
such that it's data gets embedded into the HTML page. We define
it using "display=none" so it is hidden in the presentation. 
We can then refer to the image in "data-background-image". 
-->

![bfly]
[bfly]: images/butterfly.png "Butterfly" { display:none }

## Basement Level 3 { data-background-image:images/butterfly.png }
That's it, time to go back up.

[![arrowup]][back2]

[arrowup]:  images/arrow.png "Up arrow" { width:178px; height:238px; transform:rotate(180deg) }
[back2]:    #vertical { .image }

~ End Vertical


## Themes {#themes}

Reveal.js comes with a few themes built in:

* [Default](?#/themes)
* [Sky](?theme=sky#/themes)
* [Beige](?theme=beige#/themes)
* [Serif](?theme=serif#/themes)
* [Simple](?theme=simple#/themes)
* [Night](?theme=night#/themes)
* [Moon](?theme=moon#/themes)
* [Solarized](?theme=solarized#/themes)

Theme demos are loaded after the presentation which leads to flicker. In
production you should load your theme in the `<head>` using a
`<link>`.

## Transitions { #transitions }

You can select from different transitions, like:\
[Cube](?transition=cube#/transitions) -
[Page](?transition=page#/transitions) -
[Concave](?transition=concave#/transitions) -
[Zoom](?transition=zoom#/transitions) -
[Linear](?transition=linear#/transitions) -
[Fade](?transition=fade#/transitions) -
[None](?transition=none#/transitions) -
[Default](?#/transitions)



## Pauses?

Some pauses.

* {.fragment} One
* {.fragment} Two
* {.fragment} Three

And more:

- Test 1
- Test 2
- Test 3
{.fragmented}

Cool!.

## Point of View

In Reveal.js Press **ESC** to enter the slide overview.

Hold down alt and click on any element to zoom in on it using 
 [zoom.js]. Alt + click anywhere to zoom back out.


[zoom.js]: http://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js


## Works in Mobile Safari

Try it out! You can swipe through the slides and pinch your way to the
overview.


## Printing

You can print a `revealjs` presentation nicely from the browser.

First give the `?print-pdf` or `?print-paper` query on your final
presentation (in the browser address bar) and then print from the Chrome
browser selecting `Save to PDF`.

Read more about it at the [revealjs documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export)

## RevealJS library

Normally, the `revealjs` library is loaded from a CDN but you can specify your
own url using metadata:

    Reveal Url: <my url>

This can be useful when using a [server to run revealjs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#full-setup)
where you may use something like:

    @nopreview Reveal Url: http://localhost:8000/reveal.js
